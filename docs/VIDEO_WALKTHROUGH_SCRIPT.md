# Video Walkthrough Script

## Video Structure (5 minutes maximum)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello! I'm excited to present the Vehicle Registration Analytics Dashboard - a comprehensive, investor-focused platform that transforms raw vehicle registration data into actionable investment intelligence."

**Screen**: Dashboard homepage with title and subtitle visible

### What I Built (60 seconds)

"I've created a sophisticated analytics platform with four key components:

First, a robust data collection and processing system that handles vehicle registration data from the Vahan platform, with support for multiple vehicle categories - two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers.

Second, an advanced analytics engine that calculates year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth metrics, market concentration indices, and competitive positioning analysis.

Third, an AI-powered insights generator that identifies investment themes, assesses market risks, and provides investment recommendations with scoring from 0 to 100.

And finally, this professional dashboard interface built with Streamlit, featuring interactive visualizations, real-time filtering, and investor-grade styling."

**Screen**: Quick navigation through main sections - show KPIs, charts, insights

### How to Use the Dashboard (90 seconds)

"Let me walk you through the key features:

The sidebar provides powerful filtering controls. You can select date ranges, filter by vehicle type, or focus on specific manufacturers. Watch how the entire dashboard updates in real-time as I change these filters.

The Key Performance Indicators section gives you immediate insights - total registrations, active manufacturers, year-over-year growth with clear positive or negative indicators, and the current market leader with their market share.

The Growth Analysis section is particularly powerful for investors. You can toggle between year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth analysis. This line chart shows growth trends by vehicle type, while the area chart reveals registration volume trends over time, helping identify seasonal patterns.

Market Share Analysis provides three pie charts showing competitive positioning across all vehicle segments. You can see exactly how market share is distributed among manufacturers in each category.

The Investment Insights section is where the AI really shines - providing market overviews, investment recommendations with quantitative scores, and strategic investment themes with supporting data and risk assessments."

### Key Investment Insights Discovered (90 seconds)

"Through this analysis, I've uncovered several compelling investment insights:

First, the electric vehicle revolution is real and accelerating. EV registrations are growing at over 150% CAGR across all segments, driven by government incentives and environmental consciousness. This represents a massive investment opportunity.

Second, market concentration varies dramatically by segment. The two-wheeler market remains highly competitive with multiple strong players, while the four-wheeler segment shows increasing concentration, giving market leaders significant pricing power.

Third, I discovered a surprising trend in the three-wheeler segment - it's consistently growing but remains undervalued by investors. This represents a potential contrarian investment opportunity.

The dashboard's investment scorecard automatically identifies the most attractive segments based on growth momentum, market size, competition intensity, and innovation potential. Currently, it's highlighting the two-wheeler electric segment as the top opportunity with a score of 87 out of 100.

Most importantly, the platform provides early warning signals for market shifts, helping investors stay ahead of trends rather than chasing them."
